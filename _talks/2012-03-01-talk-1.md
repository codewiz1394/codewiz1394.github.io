Abstract:
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable potential across domains, including robotics, autonomous driving, and gaming. However, its vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses significant challenges to its reliability in real-world applications. Adversarial perturbations can exploit weaknesses in DRL models, leading to suboptimal or even unsafe decisions. This session will explore how adversarial perturbations target DRL systems, revealing critical vulnerabilities that compromise their performance and reliability. We’ll examine key attack strategies, their implications for DRL applications, and the emerging need for robust, scalable defense mechanisms. Whether you're a developer, researcher, or AI enthusiast, this talk aims to inspire new ideas in creating resilient DRL frameworks capable of withstanding adversarial threats.
